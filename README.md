# Meu Aroma E-Commerce Platform

## Introduction
"Meu Aroma" is an advanced e-commerce platform designed to provide a seamless and intuitive shopping experience for a wide range of products. Our goal is to create a user-friendly platform where customers can easily browse, select, and purchase products that meet their needs. This project leverages modern web technologies to ensure a secure, efficient, and enjoyable shopping process from product selection to checkout and secure payment. 
Meu Aroma is a real and very small family business so I decided to take this chance to create this mock web page for selling the products. Meu Aroma approaches to making our products is all about being kind to the environment. We craft our real, handmade soaps with the best practices in mind, using ingredients that are good for you and the planet. Our products are made with natural essential oils and plant-based materials, ensuring everything we offer is vegan and environmentally friendly.

Choosing Meu Aroma means choosing a product that cares for your body, mind, and our earth. It's not just about buying something nice for yourself; it's about joining a community that values living in a better, more sustainable way.
