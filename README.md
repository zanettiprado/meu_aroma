<summary> User Story Prioritization - MoSCoW Method</summary>

<br>

In order to work and decide what task I would implement first and what task I could leave under an "if" categorie I applied the agile MoSCoW methodology.

<br>

- Must-have: Essential requirements that the project must deliver.
- Should-have: Important but not essential; can be postponed if necessary.
- Could-have: Desirable but not necessary; can be delayed or omitted.
- Won't-have this time: Recognized as not being necessary for this delivery but could be considered in the future. (not applied in this project.)

Within the development cycle, user stories are prioritized using the MoSCoW approach as I said. Below is an outline of our current sprint's story allocation:

<br>

| Priority       | User Story                                               | Story Points |

**4. Brand Cohesion:** The chosen typeface complements our brand's values and identity. It embodies qualities such as sophistication, cleanliness, and simplicity, which resonate with our soap products' purity and quality.

**5. Mobile Optimization:** "Oswald" adapts well to various screen sizes, ensuring a seamless and visually pleasing experience for mobile users, a critical consideration in today's digital landscape.

<summary>Cloudinary API</summary>


We use the Cloudinary API in our project to keep our pictures and videos online because Heroku, where we host our project, doesn't save this kind of data. Here's how to get your own Cloudinary API key:

1. Create an account and log in to Cloudinary.
2. When they ask what you're interested in, pick "Programmable Media" because it's about images and videos.
3. If you want, change your cloud name to something you can remember easily.
4. On your Cloudinary Dashboard, you'll find your API Environment Variable. It looks like a long code.
5. Make sure to remove the "CLOUDINARY_URL=" part from the code because that part is your key.

<summary>Heroku Account and dployment</summary>

<br>

1. Set Up Your Heroku Account

If you don't have a Heroku account, sign up for one at https://www.heroku.com/. It's free to get started.

2. Install Heroku CLI

Download and install the Heroku Command Line Interface (CLI) for your operating system. You can find installation instructions here: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli

3. Log In to Heroku

Open your terminal or command prompt and log in to Heroku by running:
```
heroku login
```
Follow the prompts to enter your Heroku credentials.

4. Initialize a Git Repository

If your project isn't already in a Git repository, you'll need to initialize one. Navigate to your project's root directory in the terminal and run:

```
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```
5. Create a requirements.txt File

If you don't already have a requirements.txt file, create one. This file lists all the Python packages required for your project. You can generate it by running:
```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
6. Create a Procfile

Create a file named Procfile (without any file extension) in your project's root directory. This file tells Heroku how to run your application. Inside the Procfile, add:

```
web: python your_app_name/manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:$PORT
```
7. Install Gunicorn

Gunicorn is a WSGI HTTP server for Python applications. Install it by running:
```
pip install gunicorn
```

8. Add Heroku Buildpacks
Heroku uses buildpacks to determine how to build and run your application. You'll need to add Python and Node.js buildpacks if your project uses JavaScript or CSS. Run the following commands to add buildpacks:
```
heroku buildpacks:add heroku/python
```
9. Set Environment Variables

Set the environment variables in Heroku that you mentioned earlier. You can do this by running:
```
heroku config:set CLOUDINARY_URL=your_cloudinary_api_key
heroku config:set DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1
heroku config:set SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key 
```

Replace your_cloudinary_api_key, your_database_url, and your_secret_key with your actual keys and URLs.

10. Deploy to Heroku

Now it's time to deploy your project to Heroku. Run:
``` 
git push heroku master
```

This command will push your code to Heroku's servers and trigger the deployment process.

11. Run Migrations

After deploying, run the following command to apply database migrations:
``` 
heroku run python manage.py migrate 
```

12. Open Your App

Your app should be deployed and live on Heroku now! You can open it in your browser using
``` 
heroku open
```

<summary>AWS S3 Bucket for Static Files</summary>

In this project, we use Amazon S3 to store static files like images and media. Here's how to set up your AWS S3 bucket:

1. **Sign in to the AWS Management Console**.

2. **Open the Amazon S3 console**.

3. **Create a new S3 bucket**: Click the "Create bucket" button, and follow the prompts to configure your bucket. Make sure to choose a unique name and configure your bucket's permissions.

4. **Note the bucket name**: You'll need this name later to configure your project.

5. **Set up IAM (Identity and Access Management)**: Create a new IAM user with programmatic access and attach a policy that grants access to your S3 bucket. Make sure to save the access key and secret access key.

6. **Configure your project**: In your project settings, update the configuration to use your S3 bucket for static and media files. You'll need to provide your AWS access key, secret key, and the bucket name.
